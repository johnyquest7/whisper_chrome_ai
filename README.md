Browser-Based AI Assistant: Speech-to-Text with Whisper and Local AI Answers
This repository contains a web application that leverages local LLM (Chrome Built In AI ) technologies to provide a seamless voice-driven experience directly in your browser. By combining the power of OpenAI's Whisper for accurate speech recognition and Chrome's local AI for intelligent responses, this project offers a fast, private, and efficient solution for voice-based queries and interactions.


## Key Features:

Real-time speech-to-text conversion using Whisper AI

Browser-based implementation for easy accessibility

Integration with Chrome's local AI for generating responses

Privacy-focused design with on-device processing

Customizable and extensible codebase

## Files
This repository contains three main HTML files, each serving a different purpose:

1. **whisper_transcribe.html**: A basic website that demonstrates voice-to-text functionality.
2. **transcribe_and_ask_llm.html**: A simple website that combines voice-to-text transcription with Chrome AI responses. It transcribes spoken input and then uses the transcribed text to generate a response from Chrome AI.
3. **full_interface.html**: A comprehensive, responsive web interface that integrates all the features from the previous two files into a more polished and user-friendly design.

Each file builds upon the previous one, showcasing the progression from a basic voice-to-text tool to a full-featured AI-assisted voice interface.
